# web-training

I will use this repository to store everything I learn from some Pluralsight courses and educational books and documentation as I train to become my team's resident expert on web technologies. We will be using Blazor for many upcoming project initiatives, but that doesn't excuse me from knowing the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

Blazor templates come with a minified Bootstrap stylesheet, so I will take time to master Bootstrap and other ways to style a page. With time, I hope to learn SASS, SCSS, or other styling flavor; webpack or other performance processing technologies; and other styling frameworks like Tailwind.

## Phase 1
### Take a HTML/CSS assessment on Pluralsight to see where my weaknesses lie
I got 14/20 correct, so I have some work to do. Many questions I answered incorrectly were involving HTML5 and JavaScript nuances and modern browser behavior.

### Complete *Building Websites with HTML, CSS and JavaScript* learning path on Pluralsight
This is a 30.5 hour path, so it'll keep me busy for a while.
